# first-own-project
It is the first project I made entirely by myself. In it I used the following settings:
*	Javascript
*	HTML5 and CSS3
*	Flexbox
*	Responsive layout
*	Browser as database

How the program works:
*	In this project, we use an algorithm to generate 6 totally random lottery numbers. The numbers are presented to the user in ascending order. the 6 numbers can be generated from numbers 1 to 60, or from 10 different saved results. If among the results there are equal numbers, they are filtered.
*	The algorithm also makes comparisons. When generating 6 numbers, it compares the new result with a previously saved result. If 4 numbers or more match, then it stops the program. If not, it generates a new result, continuing like this up to a maximum of 15,000 attempts.
The project isn't finished yet. I still need to improve the style, but the program works fine.
